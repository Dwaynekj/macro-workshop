# macro-workshop

This workshop was originally presented at Clojure/West 2015, and was
concurrently open-sourced to help out folks who weren't able to attend the
workshop at a conference, but who still want to learn about macros.

Please feel free to open an issue if you have any questions! It doesn't have to
be a mistake in the materials, though I'd like to hear about any of those you
find as well!

Get in touch with me ([@trptcolin](https://github.com/trptcolin)) if you have
any questions or would like me to facilitate this workshop at your conference
or user group.


## Usage

The general approach here is to help attendees really grok the fundamentals.
Macros are mostly difficult when we lose track of what mode of interpretation
(code vs. data) we're using at any given time. So the demos and exercises
concentrate primarily on a rock-solid understanding on how to generate code,
and how to avoid some problem areas that tend to trip up budding macro writers.


## Suggested self-study ordering

These materials are designed such that you work in cycles, starting with the
first entry in the demo material, under `doc/macro-workshop/demo` (ideally with
an experienced macro Clojurist and macro writer available for questions), and
proceed to complete the exercises as described in the file under
`doc/exercises` corresponding to the session you're on.
